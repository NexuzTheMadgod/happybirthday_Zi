      <p>Okay, By reading this document, giggling at it, rolling your eyes fondly or confused😁, You; Zita, hereinafter referred to as "M'lady" agree to the following ridiculously romantic and slightly unhinged terms.</p>

      <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the Proprietor of this work (me), is madly in love with you;</p>

      <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, interacting with my checklists, documents, random notes, code snippets, memes, and all future "Victor creations" is basically foreplay at this point;</p>

      <p><strong>NOW THEREFORE</strong>, in consideration of unlimited peach time (when I see you), good morning texts, gifts and overwheming affection, late-night voice notes, and me trying (an
        d often failing) to be a good boyfriend🥲</p>

      <p>and don't worry if you didn't understand all this fluff above, it's okay, all I'm saying is; Somebody loves you; I love you</p>

To Dearest Zi,

Happy birthday, baby. 
Maybe i can't do enough to let you know that you're the one for sure. 
We started off as strangers, then friends, then Lovers.
Fast-forward to now, there's so much to wonder about.
‎But, let's really talk about you.
It's your personality, your simplicity to everything,
You're a great person to be around cause you give out so much love;
something i now understand you got from your home.
It's why when it comes to you, i can't substitute the best version of myself to offer you. 
I love you together with the people who've showed you how special you are today,
But if you can't ever trust their love, just know somebody loves you

With all my love,
Chiboy.
